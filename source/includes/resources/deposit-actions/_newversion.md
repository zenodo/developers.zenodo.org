### New version

Create a new version of a deposition.

This action will create a new deposit, which will be a snapshot of the current resouce, inheriting the metadata as well as snapshot of files.
The new version deposit will have a state similar to a new, unpublished deposit, most importantly its files will be modifiable as for a new deposit.

Only one unpublished new version deposit can be available at any moment, i.e.: calling new version action multiple times will have no effect, as long as the resulting new version deposit from the first call is not published or deleted.

NOTE: The response body of this action is NOT the new version deposit, but the original resource.
The new version deposition can be accessed through the ``"latest_draft"`` under ``"links"`` in the response body.
